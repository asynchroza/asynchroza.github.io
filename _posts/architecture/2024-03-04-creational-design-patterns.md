## Singleton

The singleton pattern involves creating a constructor that always returns a reference to the first created object of the class. These are helpful when you want to share state between different parts of the software.

```typescript
type Global = {
  logger?: Logger;
};

const global: Global = { logger: undefined };

class Logger {
  constructor() {
    if (global.logger) {
      return global.logger;
    }

    global.logger = this;
    return this;
  }

  info(message: any) {
    console.log(`[INFO - ${new Date().toDateString()}] ${message}`);
  }
}

const logger = new Logger();

logger.info("Hello, world!");
```

Now, letâ€™s read through the code above. While there are various libraries for handling logging, there are instances where additional logic is necessary. Therefore, to avoid creating multiple instances of the logger and generating unnecessary work for the garbage collector, we can simply retain the same instance and use it in all parts of our application.

Here we compare the two references, and as you can see, JavaScript returns `true` meaning that we have fetched the same object when using the constructor both times.

## Factory Method

The Factory Method design pattern... The first time I encountered this design pattern, I didn't grasp the fact that when they refer to a `method`, they mean a class method, not just a way of instantiating objecs. Well, in a sense, it is related to creating objects, but the main point here is that we establish what is known as an abstract factory. This abstract factory essentially provides a hook for creating said objects.

Why do we need this? The Factory Method allows us to separate the object construction logic from the code that actually uses these objects.

In Quickbase, we recently worked on extending the collection of assets our marketplace supports. We have an application where you can upload an asset and make a request towards the backend to have this asset published to different environments.

For the sake of a good example, I rewrote the factory pattern we used there to conform to the design pattern we're trying to explain here.

```typescript
abstract class AssetPublishingService {
  abstract publish(): void;
}

class ImagePublishingService extends AssetPublishingService {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  publish(): void {
    console.log("Publishing image");
  }
}

class VideoPublishingService extends AssetPublishingService {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  publish(): void {
    console.log("Publishing video");
  }
}

abstract class AssetPublishingServiceFactory {
  abstract createService(): AssetPublishingService;
}

class ImagePublishingServiceFactory extends AssetPublishingServiceFactory {
  createService(): AssetPublishingService {
    return new ImagePublishingService();
  }
}

class VideoPublishingServiceFactory extends AssetPublishingServiceFactory {
  createService(): AssetPublishingService {
    return new VideoPublishingService();
  }
}
```

We first define an abstract base class called `AssetPublishingService` which has an abstract method called `createService`. This method will be used by the subclasses to create the corresponding services.

Then, we define the two factories which will accordignly create new objects either of the type `VideoPublishingService` or `ImagePublishingService`.

Sounds good. But why?

```typescript
function publishAsset(factory: AssetPublishingServiceFactory) {
  const service = factory.createService();

  service.publish(); // implementation which differs under the hood

  // update upload status in admin app for uploading assets
  // send notifications to clients that a new asset is available in their environment
}

// ...

if (request.type === "image") {
  publishAsset(new ImagePublishingServiceFactory());
} else if (request.type === "video") {
  publishAsset(new VideoPublishingServiceFactory());
}
```

This allows for flexibility and extensibility in the system, as new services can be created without modifying the code which handles the common functionality for publishing assets. Hence, if we decide to implement logic for publishing assets of type `WAV` or `MP3`, the only thing we will have to define is the new asset class with its publishing method accordingly, as well as a new factory. The code in `publishAsset` stays the same.

## Prototype

The prototype, or so called _clone_ pattern, is just simply exposing a hook for deep cloning data from a source.

Let's imagine the following scenario. You have an in-house API session manager which default exports only one instance of the class. Nevertheless,
the class is also exported, allowing you to persist the state in one section of the code without worrying about potential overwrites from another part. If you wish to maintain the current session, you can create a clone.

```typescript
type UserCredentials = {
  token: string;
};

export class APIStateManager {
  userCredentials: UserCredentials;

  async clone(APIStateManager: APIStateManager) {
    this.userCredentials = APIStateManager.userCredentials;
  }

  async login(username: string, password: string) {
    const response = await fetch("/login", {
      body: JSON.stringify({
        username,
        password,
      }),
    });

    return response;
  }

  async get(endpoint: string, body: Record<string, unknown>) {
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
      body: JSON.stringify(body),
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.userCredentials.token}`,
      },
    });

    return response;
  }
}

const apiManager = new APIStateManager();
export default apiManager;
```

Let's imagine you have two separate request handlers, and one request handler uses the `login` right before the other handler invokes the `get` method. The credentials will be overwritten and the second's handlers invocation will fail. In order, to persist two separate sessions, we have to create a new instance and use the other one as a prototype.

```typescript
const apiManagerClone = new APIStateManager();
apiManagerClone.clone(apiManager);

await apiManagerClone.get("/hello", { name: "Someone" });
```

Now, with this approach, we can confidently proceed, knowing that sessions won't be overwritten.
