## Undirected graphs

In undirected graphs all edges are **bidirectional** in nature.
**Edges** are the connections between different vertexes.
The **degree** of a vertex is the number of connected edges.
Thefore, if there are two other vertexes adjacened to said vertex,
but there is one edge looping and connecting to the it, the number of degrees is 3.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

graph = {"A": [], "B": [], "C": [], "D": [], "E": [], "F": [], "G": []}

def create_graph():
    edges = [
        ["A", "B"], ["A", "E"],
        ["A", "C"], ["B", "D"],
        ["B", "E"], ["C", "F"],
        ["C", "G"], ["D", "E"]
    ]

    for edge in edges:
        a, b = edge[0], edge[1]

        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)

    return graph
```

This implementation would yield the following result:

```json
{
  "A": ["B", "E", "C"],
  "B": ["A", "D", "E"],
  "C": ["A", "F", "G"],
  "D": ["B", "E"],
  "E": ["A", "B", "D"],
  "F": ["C"],
  "G": ["C"]
}
```

This type of graph storage is called an **adjacency list**.
Each vertex in the graph is stored as a key in a data structure (in this case, an object or dictionary).
The corresponding value for each vertex key is a list (or array) containing the vertices that are adjacent to the key vertex.
